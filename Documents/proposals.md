write something


For the cubic lattice with tight-binding approximation, the energy of the s-band is given by $$E_S(\vec{k})=E_S-\beta-\sum_{\vec{R}_m \neq 0} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{R}_m} \gamma\left(\vec{R}_m\right),$$ where the sum is limited to the nearest neighbors.

For (1), the energy of the s-band is given by $E_S$, and the width of the band is $\Delta E_s = 2 \beta + 2 \gamma \left (\vec{R_m}
