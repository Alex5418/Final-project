The dispersion relation for the phonon in the one-dimensional single atom lattice, considering the interaction of each atom with all the other atoms, can be expressed by the formula $$\omega(k)=\sqrt{\frac{2 D}{m} \sin^2\left(\frac{k a}{2}\right)},$$ where $\omega(k)$ is the frequency of the phonon with wave vector $k$, $D$ is the force constant, and $m$ is the mass of an atom.
