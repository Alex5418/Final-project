**Contributed by Sirui Zhang, Muye Yuan, Yiduo Wang, Zonghan Wu** 
## Introduction
This project is done by team4321 in 2022 fall semester cs 225 class. The datasets come from Openflights, and this project can help you find the shortest routes between two airports, and give you a list of the 10 most important airports in the world. Although all the datasets come from 2014, but we can still get important ideas from the history. We hope this project can help people to learn data structure and use it to find the shortest route. Hope you enjoy our project.
- Main algorithms: BFS, Dijkstra, and PageRank
- How these algorithms work:
  - BFS: Used to find all routes between two airports
  - Dijkstra: Used to find the shortest route
  - PageRank: Used to find the most important airports
